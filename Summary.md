## üìà Nasdaq-Closing-Price-Prediction-Challenge: An Optiver Case Study
---

### 1. Abstract üéØ
---

This project aims to develop a sophisticated model capable of predicting the closing price movements of Nasdaq-listed stocks during the critical final ten minutes of the trading day. 

By integrating and analyzing data from both the order book and closing auctions, the model leverages insights into nuanced supply and demand dynamics to forecast price movements and identify lucrative trading opportunities.

The predictive performance of the model is measured using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predicted and observed stock closing prices.

### 2. Introduction üöÄ
---

Predicting stock market movements, especially in the volatile closing minutes, is a complex challenge that attracts significant attention from financial analysts and traders.  

This project focuses on harnessing detailed order book data and closing auction information to build a model that not only predicts the closing prices but also uncovers potential trading strategies during peak trading times. To optimize the model‚Äôs parameters, we employ Optuna, a sophisticated hyperparameter optimization framework. 

### 3. Data Collection
---

#### 3.1 Order Book üìñ

An order book is a fundamental component in financial markets, representing a real-time, continuously updated record of buy and sell orders for a specific financial instrument. 

Typically, an order book is maintained by an exchange (such as Nasdaq) and plays a critical role in the price discovery process. Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown:

#### 3.2 Structure üèóÔ∏è

The order book lists various buy orders (bids) and sell orders (asks) for an asset. Each entry typically includes the price at which a buyer or seller is willing to transact and the quantity of the asset they wish to buy or sell at that price. 

The order book is organized in a manner where the highest bidding price is matched with the lowest asking price.

#### 3.3 Types of Orders üìë

- **Limit Orders**: These are orders to buy or sell a stock at a specified price or better. They are placed in the order book until they are filled or canceled.
  
- **Market Orders**: Orders to buy or sell immediately at the best available current price. They do not enter the order book as they are executed instantly by matching with the best available opposite order.

#### 3.4 Functions üîç

- **Price Discovery**: The interaction of buy and sell orders in an order book helps establish the fair market price of a stock.
  
- **Liquidity**: A dense order book, with lots of buy and sell orders at various prices, generally indicates high liquidity, allowing large volumes of trades to occur with minimal impact on the stock's price.
  
- **Market Depth**: The order book displays the market depth, which is an indicator of the quantity available for trading closer to the bid and ask prices. A deeper market can handle larger orders without a significant impact on the price.

#### 3.4 Closing Auction üîî

The closing auction is a mechanism used by stock exchanges to determine the official closing prices of stocks. This process typically occurs at the end of the trading day and is especially significant because many derivatives and index funds use these prices for valuations. Here‚Äôs how it works:

#### 3.6 Process üîÑ

1. **Order Collection**: Exchanges begin by collecting orders specifically meant for the auction during a period leading up to the close. These orders might include market-on-close (MOC) or limit-on-close (LOC) orders, which are intended to execute at the closing price.
   
2. **Price Determination**: The closing price is determined through a process that balances buy and sell orders to maximize the volume of shares that can be executed. The price at which this equilibrium is achieved becomes the official closing price.
   
3. **Execution**: At the closing price, all orders collected for the closing auction are executed. This often results in a significant volume of trades happening at one price point at the end of the trading session.

### 4. Dataset Description üóÉÔ∏è
---

This dataset contains historic data for the daily ten-minute closing auction on the NASDAQ stock exchange.

**stock_id:**
- **Description:** A unique identifier for each stock.
- **Context:** Not every stock appears in every time bucket (a specific, often small, period of time during trading), making this identifier crucial for tracking the performance and data specific to each stock across different periods.
  
**date_id:**
- **Description:** A unique identifier for the date on which the trading data was recorded. These IDs are sequential and consistent across all stocks.
- **Context:** Allows the model to differentiate data across different trading days and to identify trends or patterns over time.

**imbalance_size:**
- **Description:** Represents the volume of shares that remain unmatched at the current reference price, expressed in USD.
- **Context:** A critical measure in understanding supply and demand dynamics at the closing auction, influencing the model's ability to predict price movements based on existing imbalances.

**imbalance_buy_sell_flag:**
- **Description:** A categorical flag indicating the direction of the auction imbalance:
1 for a buy-side imbalance (more demand than supply)
-1 for a sell-side imbalance (more supply than demand)
0 for no imbalance
- **Context:** This indicator helps in predicting whether the price is likely to rise or fall at the close, based on whether there is excess buying pressure or selling pressure.

**matched_size:**
- **Description:** The total amount in USD that can be matched at the current reference price.
- **Context:** Indicates the volume of trades that can be executed without affecting the market price too significantly, crucial for understanding market liquidity.

**far_price, near_price, [bid/ask]_price, [bid/ask]_size:**

- **Description:** These are various price points and quantities in the order book.
  
Far price and near price likely relate to the prices available at further and closer points in the order book.

[bid/ask]_price are the highest buy and lowest sell prices respectively.

[bid/ask]_size are the volumes available at these prices.

- **Context: These metrics provide detailed insights into the order book's depth and the distribution of buy and sell orders around the reference price, informing predictions on price movement pressures.

**wap (Weighted Average Price):**

- **Description:** Calculated over a specific time frame within the non-auction book, it's a price that reflects the average price at which stocks are traded, weighted by volume.
- **Context:** WAP is used to gauge the average trading price over a period, often used in financial models to understand market trends and to normalize the impact of large trades on simple average price calculations.

**target:**

- **Description:** The difference between the 60-second future movement in the stock's WAP and the 60-second future movement of a synthetic index, provided only in the training set.

- **Context:** Serves as the dependent variable in training the model. It represents the relative movement of a stock's price compared to the market, which is central to predicting future price movements effectively.

### 5. Model Development
---

- **Predictive Model:** Utilize machine learning techniques like Random Forests and LightGBM to predict closing prices.
  
- **Integration of Data Sources:** Develop a methodology to seamlessly integrate order book and auction data for holistic analysis.

### 6. Model Initialization
---

lgbm_model = lgbm.LGBMRegressor(objective='mae', n_estimators=500, random_state=1234)

**(Study Math of Random Forest and LightGBM)**

**LGBMRegressor:**

This class implements the LightGBM regressor. A regressor predicts continuous values, which is appropriate for predicting stock prices as continuous numerical data.

#### 6.1 **Parameters:**

- **objective='mae':** Specifies the loss function to be minimized in the learning process. Here, 'mae' stands for Mean Absolute Error, which aligns with the project‚Äôs evaluation criteria. 

It measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction (i.e., whether they are over or underestimates).

- **n_estimators=500:** This defines the number of boosting stages the model has to go through. More trees can lead to a more accurate model but can also cause overfitting if not handled correctly. In this context, 500 trees are chosen to balance between bias and variance.

- **random_state=1234:** This parameter ensures reproducibility of the model‚Äôs results by providing a fixed seed for the random number generator, which influences aspects of model training like the selection of features at each split.

#### 6.2 Feature Engineering

Add 3 new features related imbalance_ratio, bid-size and ask-size.

1. **New Feature: imbalance_ratio**

- **Definition:** It is calculated as the division of imbalance_size by matched_size.
  
imbalance_size: This could represent the volume of shares that remain unmatched at the current reference price.

- **matched_size:** This typically indicates the volume of shares that can be matched at the current reference price.

**Significance of the imbalance_ratio Feature**

- **Insight into Market Dynamics:** This ratio provides insight into the relative size of unmatched orders compared to matched orders at the reference price, potentially signaling market pressure (either buying or selling pressure) that isn't fully resolved by current order matches.
  
- **Indicator of Market Sentiment:** A high imbalance_ratio might suggest a strong imbalance in buy or sell orders that could affect the stock price shortly, especially during the closing auction when liquidity and volatility are high.

2. **imbl_size1**

- **Definition:** The normalized difference between bid_size and ask_size.
- **Formula:** (df['bid_size'] - df['ask_size']) / (df['bid_size'] + df['ask_size'])
- **Purpose:** Captures the net order flow direction, indicating whether buying or selling pressure is dominant.

3. **imbl_size2**

- **Definition:** The normalized difference between imbalance_size and matched_size.
- **Formula:** (df['imbalance_size'] - df['matched_size']) / (df['imbalance_size'] + df['matched_size'])
- **Purpose:** Similar to imbalance_ratio but focuses on the relative difference rather than the ratio, providing another perspective on market liquidity and order imbalance.
